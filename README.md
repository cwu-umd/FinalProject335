App Description - Our application is called TerpXChange & it is a Node.js
application that allows UMD students to buy/sell textbooks to each other in
a new & fun way. This allows students to save hundreds of dollars a semester
just on textbooks or help students make some quick easy cash. We also have 
implemented the [API_NAME] API to show students the best price on the textbook 
across the web even if it's not on our application to prevent sellers from 
price-gouging, because knowing the students get the best deal is what is 
most important to TerpXChange.
