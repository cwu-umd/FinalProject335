App Description - Our application is called TerpXChange & it is a Node.js
application that allows UMD students to buy/sell textbooks to each other in
a new & fun way. This allows students to save hundreds of dollars a semester
just on textbooks or help students make some quick easy cash. We also have 
implemented the third party Amazon API called Rainforest API to show students 
the best price on the textbook across the web even if it's not on our application 
to prevent sellers from price-gouging, because knowing the students get the best 
deal is what is most important to TerpXChange.
